In the real world, data sets typically come split across many tables while most data analysis functions in R are designed to work with single tables of data. 
  In this course, you'll learn how to effectively combine data sets into single tables using data.table. You'll learn how to add columns from one table to another table, 
  how to filter a table based on observations in another table, and how to identify records across multiple tables matching complex criteria. Along the way, you'll learn how
